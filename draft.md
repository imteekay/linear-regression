# Linear Regression

## [model representation](https://github.com/imteekay/linear-regression/blob/main/model_representation.ipynb)

- [ ]  problem: house prediction
- [ ]  example of data points: two points
- [ ]  divide into two parts: feature (X) and target (Y)
- [ ]  plotting the data
- [ ]  model function for linear regression f(x) = xw + b
- [ ]  trying a random w and b to see if the mode fits the data
- [ ]  finding the best w and b that fit the data
- [ ]  plotting the new function
- [ ]  making a prediction for a new input

```
- `Linear function`: with random Ws and Bs, the model produces a function. For linear regression, the function is a line
  - Draw a line describing the data points (dataset behavior)
  - The line is a function built by the learning algorithm (model)
  - The function receives an input (features) and output a prediction (y-hat), the estimated value of y
  - The idea of the model is to ask what's the math formula for `f`
